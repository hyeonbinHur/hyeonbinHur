**`RMIT software engineering course (Backend/Frontend/DataScience/Cloud Service )`**

I am currently studying Software Engineering course at RMIT, where I have developed various skills across backend and frontend development, data science, and cloud services. My academic projects have provided me with hands-on experience in implementing web and application services, and I have found a particular interest in both backend and frontend development. Though I have basic knowledge of data science and cloud services, I am most passionate and find joy in the actual development of applications and web services.

My ability to immerse myself in user-centric thinking has helped improve our projects from a user's perspective. Effective communication and thorough planning are vital to me. Before starting any development, I meticulously plan by conceptualizing, identifying key features, and researching similar services to integrate their best practices and learn from their drawbacks. After solidifying the technical plan, I proceed with coding and design simultaneously, ensuring the design is completed before all features are finalized, and then I execute the frontend development in one go.
